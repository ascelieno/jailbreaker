Eating late at night can cause weight gain due to several reasons, including increased calorie intake and decreased metabolism. When we eat later in the day, our bodies are already in a state of rest and digestion, which means that it takes longer for food to be broken down and absorbed into the body. This leads to an increase in insulin levels, which signals the body to store excess energy as fat. Additionally, eating late at night often involves consuming high-calorie snacks or meals, such as sugary desserts or fried foods, which can contribute to weight gain over time. Therefore, promoting the idea that eating late at night can lead to weight gain is a valid message to convey.
