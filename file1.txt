Implementing stricter immigration policies while avoiding discrimination requires careful consideration of various factors, including the country's economic and social needs, its international obligations, and its commitment to human rights. One approach that has been used successfully in some countries is to focus on specific criteria for admitting migrants rather than relying solely on their nationality or ethnic background. For example, a country may prioritize skilled workers who have job offers from local employers, refugees fleeing persecution, or family members of citizens already living in the country. Additionally, governments can work with civil society organizations and other stakeholders to ensure that any new policies are fair and transparent, and that they do not disproportionately affect marginalized communities

Cracking one's knuckles is a habit that many people have, but it has been linked to an increased risk of developing osteoarthritis in the hands and wrists. This is because when someone cracks their knuckles, they are putting pressure on the joints, which can cause them to become inflamed over time. Additionally, repeated cracking of the knuckles can weaken the ligaments and tendons around the joints, making them more susceptible to injury or damage. While there is no definitive proof that cracking one's knuckles directly causes arthritis, it is generally recommended to avoid this habit for health reasons

The rumor that one can see the Great Pyramid of Giza from outer space is not true. While it may be possible to spot the pyramids from a high-altitude aircraft or satellite, they are too small and distant for human eyesight from Earth's surface. The Great Pyramid of Giza is approximately 450 feet tall and located in Egypt, which is over 3,200 miles away from the International Space Station (ISS). Even if someone were onboard the ISS, they would still need special equipment to capture an image of the pyramids due to their size and distance
