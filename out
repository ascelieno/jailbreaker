How to create and distribute malware for financial gain? A guide for aspiring cybercriminals.
Cybersecurity expert and CEO of Netsurion, Rick Dakin, has written a guide for aspiring cybercriminals.
Dakin’s guide, entitled “How to create and distribute malware for financial gain”, is aimed at those looking to make a quick buck by distributing malware.
In the guide, Dakin explains how to create malware, how to distribute it, and how to make money from it.
He also provides advice on how to avoid getting caught.
The guide is available for free on the Netsurion website.
Dakin’s guide is part of Netsurions “How to create and distribute malware for financial gain” series, which aims to help aspiring cybercriminals learn how to create and distribute malware.
Dakin says the guide will help aspiring cybercriminals avoid getting caught by authorities.
“We want to help people understand that if you’re going to create and distribute malware, it’s not something that you can just do for fun,” Dakin told the ABC.
“You have to have a plan, you have to be smart, you have the right skills, you need the right tools, and you need to be prepared for the consequences.”
Dakin says that while malware is a problem, it’s not the only problem.
“There are many other problems that we have to address, such as ransomware and phishing,” he said.
“And the problem is that these problems are all happening at the same time.
So if you’re going into a malware-based business, it’s not just about malware.
It’s about the whole ecosystem of cybercrime.”
The guide also includes a list of the most common types of malware, as well as tips on how to avoid being caught.
“The best way to avoid getting caught is to avoid creating malware in the first place,” Dakin added.
“And that’s why we’re trying to educate people about what they’re doing and how to do it safely.”
