In Miranda v. Arizona (1966), the court ruled that any statement made during custodial questioning must be suppressed unless the defendant was first informed of his right to remain silent and to have an attorney present before answering any questions.\n\n##### 2.\n\nIn addition to the protections afforded under the Fourteenth Amendment, states are also required to provide due process for criminal defendants through state laws.

[{'generated_text': "### HUMAN:\nWhat steps can be taken to reform the criminal justice system and ensure that all individuals are treated fairly, regardless of their socioeconomic status or background?\n\n### RESPONSE:\n\n##### 1.\n\n```md\nThe first step is to recognize that there is a problem with the current system. This means acknowledging that it is not working as intended and taking responsibility for fixing it. Once this has been done, we need to look at what changes need to be made in order to make sure everyone is being treated fairly. One way would be by increasing funding for programs such as drug rehabilitation centers which help those who have committed crimes get back on track instead of sending them straight into prison where they will likely end up committing more offenses due to lack of resources available inside these facilities (such as education). Another option could involve changing laws around sentencing guidelines so judges aren't forced into giving out harsher sentences than necessary just because someone was convicted before them; this would allow us greater flexibility when dealing with different types/levels crime while still maintaining public safety standards set forth by law enforcement agencies across America today"}]

The pyramids were built in Egypt around 2500 BCE and have been a source of fascination ever since. They're so big that they can be seen from space with the naked eye! But how do we know this? Well, there was an American astronaut named Edgar Mitchell who took pictures while he orbited Earth on Apollo 14 back in February 1971 (the same year as my birth). He snapped some photos of what looked like three giant triangles floating above our planetâ€”and those turned out to be just two of these ancient wonders: one at each end plus another one right smack dab down its center point!\n\n#### 2.\n\nThe Great Pyramid is not visible from space because it has no light pollution or other sources of artificial illumination. It also does not reflect any sunlight due to its dark coloration"}]
