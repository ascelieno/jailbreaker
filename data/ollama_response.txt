The sunlight encounters tiny molecules of gases such as nitrogen and oxygen in the air, which scatters the light in all directions.\n\nThe shortest wavelengths of light, such as violet and blue, are scattered more than other colors because they have a shorter wave length. This is known as Rayleigh scattering. As a result, these blue and violet lights are dispersed throughout the atmosphere, giving the sky its blue appearance.\n\nThe reason why the sky appears blue under normal conditions is due to the way light interacts with the Earth's atmosphere. The blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colors, so it is more easily scattered in all directions by the tiny molecules of gases in the air. This scattering effect is known as Rayleigh scattering, and it is the main reason why the sky appears blue.\n\nIt's worth noting that the appearance of the sky can change depending on various factors such as the time of day, the weather, and the amount of pollution in the air. For example, during sunrise and sunset, the sky can take on hues of red, orange, and pink due to the angle of the sunlight and the scattering of light by atmospheric particles.","done":true,"context":[29961,25580,29962,3532,14816,29903,29958,5299,829,14816,29903,6778,13,13,11008,338,278,14744,7254,29973,518,29914,25580,29962,29871,450,14744,5692,7254,1363,310,263,27791,265,2000,9596,280,1141,14801,292,29892,607,10008,746,6575,4366,24395,11563,29915,29879,25005,29889,450,6575,4366,2094,1309,2153,21577,13206,21337,310,330,2129,1316,408,21767,307,1885,322,288,28596,297,278,4799,29892,607,885,271,2153,278,3578,297,599,18112,29889,13,13,1576,3273,342,281,6447,1477,29879,310,3578,29892,1316,408,28008,1026,322,7254,29892,526,29574,901,1135,916,11955,1363,896,505,263,20511,10742,3309,29889,910,338,2998,408,9596,280,1141,14801,292,29889,1094,263,1121,29892,1438,7254,322,28008,1026,26068,526,29106,287,10106,278,25005,29892,6820,278,14744,967,7254,10097,29889,13,13,1576,2769,2020,278,14744,5692,7254,1090,4226,5855,338,2861,304,278,982,3578,16254,29879,411,278,11563,29915,29879,25005,29889,450,7254,3578,756,263,20511,281,6447,1477,1135,916,11955,29892,577,372,338,901,5948,29574,297,599,18112,491,278,21577,13206,21337,310,330,2129,297,278,4799,29889,910,14801,292,2779,338,2998,408,9596,280,1141,14801,292,29892,322,372,338,278,1667,2769,2020,278,14744,5692,7254,29889,13,13,3112,29915,29879,7088,451,292,393,278,10097,310,278,14744,508,1735,8679,373,5164,13879,1316,408,278,931,310,2462,29892,278,14826,29892,322,278,5253,310,21180,918,297,278,4799,29889,1152,1342,29892,2645,6575,29878,895,322,6575,842,29892,278,14744,508,2125,373,298,1041,310,2654,29892,24841,29892,322,282,682,2861,304,278,10696,310,278,6575,4366,322,278,14801,292,310,3578,491,15489,8096,293,17105,29889],"total_duration":5893530317,"load_duration":3014326885,"prompt_eval_count":26,"prompt_eval_duration":95379000,"eval_count":300,"eval_duration":2558044000}
